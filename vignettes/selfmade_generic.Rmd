## Objective

This vignette describes the generic use of the `selfmade` software to produce valid post-selection inference, or more specifically *selective inference*, for linear mixed and additive models after any type of variable selection mechanism, which can be repeated in a bootstrap-like manner.

## Prerequisites

- The framework assumes that covariates in all models are fixed.
- It must be possible to fit the final model with the `gamm4` function of the eponymous R package. Support for models from `mgcv` will be added in the future.
- It must be possible to define a __deterministic__ function of a vector $y \in \mathbb{R}^n$ (referred to as `selection_function` in the following) determining the selection result for which the practioner seeks valid inference statements. In other words, the user has to define a function similar to the function `selection_function` defined below, which is deterministic in the sense that for the same input `y` the output should also be exactly the same.
- It must be possible to define a function, which checks the congruency of the result of the `selection_function` and the original selection given when performing model selection on the original data $y$. This is usually trivial and just a wrapper for the `selection_function`.

```{r}
selection_function <- function(y)
{
  
  # based on any input y of the same dimension as the original response
  # a model is selected and mapped to an integer value
  # ....
  best_model_index <- get_best_model(list_of_models)
  
  return(best_model_index)
  
}
```

Note that the `selection_function` should return the original result when called with the original data vector $y$.

## Approach

1. Run the experiment with the `original_response`
2. Save the model selection result (e.g., as integer indicating the selected model) as well as the final model `final_model` (after refitting the model with `gamm4` if a different package has been used for model selection)
3. Define the model selection function (`selection_function`)
4. Define the wrapper (`check_congruency`) function returning a logical value whether the result of any model call of `selection_function` is equivalent to the original model selection result
5. Run the `mocasin`-function providing selective inference as follows:

```{r}
res <- mocasin(mod = final_model,
               checkFun = check_congruency,
               this_y = original_response
               # further options
               )
```


## Examples

* Example 1 demonstrates the package's ability to reproduce classical inference if no model selection was done.
* Example 2 demonstrates the use of the package for model selection with only `gamm4` models
* Example 3 demonstrates the package's ability to calculate valid inference regardless of the type of model selection and packages involved (as long as the prerequisites are met)

### Example 1

```{r}
library(selfmade)
library(gamm4)
set.seed(0)
dat <- gamSim(1,n=500,scale=2) ## simulate 4 term additive truth

dat$y <- 3 + dat$x0^2 + rnorm(n=500)
br <- gamm4(y~ s(x0) + s(x1), data = dat)
summary(br$gam) ## summary of gam

# do not use any selection
# - hence it's not necessary to define selection_function
#   and the checl_congruency always returns TRUE
checkFun <- function(yb) TRUE

# calculate selective inference, which, in this case,
# except for an approximation error, should be equivalent
# to the unconditional inference
res <- mocasin(br, this_y = dat$y,
               checkFun = checkFun,
               nrlocs = c(0.7,1),
               nrSamples = 1000, trace = FALSE)
# we get very similar results using
do.call("rbind", res$selinf)
```

### Example 2

```{r}
library(selfmade)
library(lme4)
library(lmerTest)
# use the ham data and use scaled information liking
# as response
ham$Informed.liking <- scale(ham$Informed.liking)

# We first define a function to fit a model based on response
# This function is usually not required but can be 
# specified in order to define the selection_function
# as a function of the model instead of as a function
# of the response vector
modFun <- function(y)
{
  ham$y <- y
  lmer(y ~ Gender + Information * Product + (1 | Consumer) +
  (1 | Product), data=ham)
  
  }

# define the selection_function:
# here this is done as function of a model
# which, in combination with modFun, can then
# be used as function 
selFun <- function(mod) step(mod, reduce.fixed = FALSE)

# define a function which extracts the results 
# of the selection procedure
extractSelFun <- function(this_mod){

this_mod <- attr(this_mod, "model")
if(class(this_mod)=="lm") 
  return(attr(this_mod$coefficients, "names")) else
    return(c(names(fixef(this_mod)), 
             names(getME(this_mod, "theta"))))

}

# Now we run the initial model selection on the 
# orginal data, which is a 
# backward elimination of non-significant effects:
(step_result <- selFun(modFun(ham$Informed.liking)))
attr(step_result, "model")
# Elimination tables for random- and fixed-effect terms:
(sel <- extractSelFun(step_result))

# Now we can define the function checking the congruency
# with the original selection
checkFun <- function(yb){ 

 this_mod <- modFun(yb)
 setequal( extractSelFun(selFun(this_mod)), sel )
 
 }

# and compute valid p-values conditional on the selection
# (this takes some time and will produce a lot of warnings)
res <- mocasin(attr(step_result, "model"), this_y = ham$Informed.liking,
          checkFun = checkFun, which = 1:4, nrSamples = 50, trace = FALSE)

print(res)
```

### Example 3

```{r}
# Run an AIC comparison between different additive models 
# fitted with mgcv::gam
library(selfmade)
library(mgcv)
library(gamm4)

# create data and models
set.seed(2)
# use enough noise to get a diverse model selection
dat <- gamSim(1,n=400,dist="normal",scale=10)
b0123 <- gam(y~s(x0)+s(x1)+s(x2)+s(x3),data=dat)
b123 <- gam(y~s(x1)+s(x2)+s(x3),data=dat)
b013 <- gam(y~s(x0)+s(x1)+s(x3),data=dat)

# seems that the second model seems to be the most 
# 'appropriate' one
which.min(AIC(b0123, b123, b013)$AIC)
# and refit the model with gamm4
b123_gamm4 <- gamm4(y~s(x0)+s(x1)+s(x3),data=dat)

# define selection_function
selection_function <- function(y)
{
  
  dat$y <- y
  list_of_models <- list(
    gam(y~s(x0)+s(x1)+s(x2)+s(x3),data=dat),
    gam(y~s(x1)+s(x2)+s(x3),data=dat),
    gam(y~s(x0)+s(x1)+s(x3),data=dat)
  )

  # return an integer value which model is best
  return(
    which.min(sapply(list_of_models, AIC))
  )
  
}

# define the congruency function
checkFun <- function(y) selection_function(y)==2

# compute inference
res <- mocasin(mod = b123_gamm4,
               checkFun = checkFun,
               nrlocs = 3, # test one position of the spline
               nrSamples = 10)
print(res)
```
